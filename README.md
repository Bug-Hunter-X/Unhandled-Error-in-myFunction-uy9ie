This repository contains a MATLAB function, myFunction.m, that demonstrates an unhandled error.  The function is designed to process input values, but it does not gracefully handle cases where the input is negative.  The bug.m file shows how the error occurs.  The bugSolution.m file shows the corrected version with improved error handling.  This example showcases how to anticipate and manage errors for improved program robustness.
